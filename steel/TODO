1) Add %error rules to steel.trison they should
	A) Set a new boolean "encountered an error" flag in the parser class
	B) Add an error string, including the line number, etc, to a list of error strings in the parser class
1.5) Remember to reset the error flag and error string list before parsing again.
2) Change steel interpreter so that, after parsing, it checks the "encountered error" flag, and displays
	all of the error strings, and does NOT attempt to run the AST. 

(14:43:12) MrDannyDP: but it can also occur that you'll get that code without ever encountering an %error rule, in which case, you'll get that Parse() error code, but your "encountered error" boolean will be false. 
(14:43:24) MrDannyDP: In which case, you go "I got an error but I dont have any clue why. Sorry."
