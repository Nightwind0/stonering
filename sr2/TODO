3) Wire up talking
4) New "choices" element, with "choice" children. They have the application present to the user choices, the user selects one, and then the app invokes the actions on that choice. Each "choice" has a choiceText attribute, and a list of actions. "choices" should live under event, and essentially be an action. That way, it can have conditions.

5) How will monsters work? How will you know what monsters to load? How will you know where you can even have monsters? 
Monster region. Can they overlap?  no.
A certain maximum per level. But each region can have multiple rectangles.
Each contains a table of monster party and incident rate. The rate is a number, 
and the chance is that number divided by the number total for that region.
So you might have a party of three Teds with an incident of 20, and several
other parties adding up to a total of 200, meaning 10% chance of three teds.


6) Need a key queue, populated at onSignalKeyUp. Then, states like say should
pull from the queue....?
