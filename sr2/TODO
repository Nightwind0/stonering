Danny TODOs
DONE 1) Order the tiles on load by zOrder
DONE 1.5) Create some sprites, get those loading and working
2) Wire up events
DONE 2.5) Get MOs drawing, updating, etc
3) Wire up stepping / talking
4) New "choices" element, with "choice" children. They have the application present to the user choices, the user selects one, and then the app returns an index to indicate which choice was made, the choices object uses that to invoke one of the choices. Each "choice" has a choiceText attribute, and a list of actions. "choices" should live under event, and essentially be an action. That way, it can have conditions.
5) Get canMove working
