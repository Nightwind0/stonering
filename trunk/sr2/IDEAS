Make a thread for handling drawing and input! That way you don't have to make it asynchronous, instead of calling run() twice on the stack you can have it in another thread, i think. Don't make it asynch. I'm convinced its wrong.

Baxwbakwalanuksiwe' ("Man-Eater at the North End of the World"; who can transform into various man-eating birds and was said to have mouths all over his body.

Huxwhukw (supernatural Crane-Like Bird who cracks skulls of men to suck out their brains)

Mad Squirrels - Think humans are a type of nut, and jump on your head and try to crack your skull open. Some sort of tie in with Jayton. They jump on your head and gnaw, usually doing some damage, but theres a small chance that they crack your skull and its instant death. Unless you're wearing special anti-squirrel helmets. 

Endospores - Possibly the Stone Ring version of slimes? But maybe not the canonical SR enemy..........

EXPONENTIAL STATS-
c*b^L
L = Level

C is a constant. Raise this or lower it for classes. For example, if the
equation is STR = c*b^L
If you want a warrior's strength to be double that of a mages, then you
will want the warriors C to be double that of the mages. 

B is the base and it determines growth rate. 
If B is set to 2, then it will double every level. If you set it to
1.07 then its more like double every 10 levels.

Note: In this way, you can't just apply attribute modifiers and forget them.
You have to keep a running tally of multipliers and adds to every stat,
and apply them when calculating (Don't forget to add in temporary bonuses!). Call the total of all multipliers m, and the total of all adds e (including start stat if any). When you calculate a stat, it looks like this:
e + mcb^L

In this case, statIncrease should take, instead of increment and period,
a "c" factor and a "b" factor. Remember, b determines growth speed and should
be close to 1.05 or so for most stats. Maybe 1.1 for HP/MP....
Experimentally, 10*1.1^L for a mages HP looks okay,and
17*1.1^L for a warrior HP looks okay... or at least somewhere around these values.
For STR and the like a single digit number times a 1.05 or so looks good.
4*1.06^L for a mage's STR maybe, and 10*1.06^L for war.


WE CAN GET RID OF startingStat!!!! 


addTemporaryModifier --
	Permanent attribute modifications will be made as they currently are,
through modifyAttribute. Basically any type of action context will result in permanent changes. I consider +50 to HP to be "permanent" just as the -37 to HP that you get when you're hit is "permanent". So potions, other items... events, etc... all do "permanent" modifications. The code inside actually modifies the character's numbers directly. Easy cheesy.. just looks up the variable to change and changes. 
	However, there are many temporary modifiers - status effects & equipment, and idols etc - do not use modifyAttribute. Instead, they use addTemporaryModifier, which returns a ticket that the caller must store away and use later on removeTemporaryModifier. Internally, each character stores a multimap (indexed by attribute enum), of a struct which describes the modification. When a value is queried, there is a loop that loops from lower_bound to upper_bound and does two things. One, it applies all the multiplications to the value. Two, it keeps a tally of all the "add" values, and after the loop, applies that total to the value. Thus, all multiplications happen, then all the adds, without having to loop twice. When "removeTemporaryModifier" is called, the modifier is simply removed from the list. The party has it's own similar list for "Common" attributes (buy rate, sell rate, drop rates, etc)
Note: Need a method which takes a characterattribute enum and returns a pointer to the member variable that corresponds. Alternatively, eschew storing attributes in member variables and use std::map<eCharacterAttribute,int>...?
	Question: How does this work for status effects and status effect resistance? What about spell types? Do they have to be hardcoded? Couldn't we define them somehow and refer to them by string.

---
Refactor? Make doAttack doMagicAttack and doStatus into Actions, that way tiles and MOs and things can use them. Define weapons as just items where the "use" is a doAttack where the attack value, rather than hardcoded, is defined by the weapon, and the target is matched to whatever is the current target. 
OR - Leave it as it is, don't consider attack as an "use" of your weapon....
but do open doAttack for skills... with a multiplier and an add and a crit%..
and it uses your current weapon...

Need: doSkill, doSpell, doEscape, doSteal, doItem
Need: Monster strategies. They should be able to select from default strategies or define special ones that should look something like
	<strategy>

Need: onEnterLevel, onExitLevel properties of the level element, which
	contains actions to fire when you enter or exit a level.
	also, there should be an exitCondition which is a regular old Condition that evaluates whether or not you can even leave the level.


Cool:
Use CL_Gradient for text/menu backgrounds, battle backgrounds.... etc (CL_Display::fill_rect)
Use set_alpha and rotate_yaw,etc, on sprites for effects. Open them up to animation
Provide an "arc" and "sine" option for animation movements, so you can have projectiles move either straight, in an arc, or a crazy sine wave.


Notes from Talking to Victor:
1) You CAN display MOs by iterating over the tiles from topleft to bottom right, even though some may take up multiple tiles, by giving them a frame count. i.e. you increment the frame count (a long?) each time you draw it and then if the frame count is already high enough then you don't have to draw it again.

2) You can fix the "MO stuck inside another MO that became relevant" problem by either ignoring it and letting the player reload the level, or by "killing" the MO and letting it respawn. It would be cool to gib the object too, just for fun, and seeing an object gib would be rare, unless you designed a level to do it. If you put a solid object in a spawn point, its a stupid idea, but the object would just gib over and over. You could also potentially have things blocked off entirely by being surrounded by tiles or stationary objects, but thats a level design consideration, not an engine consideration.

3) You can easily know which tiles to draw by adding the floor() and ciel() to the X and Y dimensions of tiles to draw around the character

4) The level object will have to take care of "step()" by checking a virtual method on the mappable objects which indicates if they are the player. If so, when he becomes aligned, step() should be called. 

5) The application should be able to query the level to get a pointer to the player. The level should keep a separate pointer latched so it doesnt have to
 search.

5) "Talk/prod" should be handled by the level, it looks at the players position and direction and determines the next cell over and executes talk on the first active MO there if any. The app just calls talk()








Skill system - some skills use Break, some use MP, some are switch on/off,
some are always on.

SKILLS:
Bartering: 10% off sales
Scouting: Increased encounters
Stealth: Decreased encounters
Treasure Hunter: Sense when hidden treasure is near


IDOLS:
You should be able to obtain idols which shift the awards you get from battle from money to goods or vice versa.
A money idol shifts you to more money.
A weapon idol shifts you towards weapons.
A potion idol " " " " 
etc.

This can be done by providing a party-wide attribute like Money%, Weapon%, etc... which the idol shifts when equipped and unshifts when
unequipped. You could have only one idol equipped, and it equips to your whole party, in a special idol slot.... There should also be idols
which attract/repel monsters.
