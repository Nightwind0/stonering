Need: onEnterLevel, onExitLevel properties of the level element, which
	contains actions to fire when you enter or exit a level.
	also, there should be an exitCondition which is a regular old Condition that evaluates whether or not you can even leave the level.


Cool:
Use CL_Gradient for text/menu backgrounds, battle backgrounds.... etc (CL_Display::fill_rect)
Use set_alpha and rotate_yaw,etc, on sprites for effects. Open them up to animation


Notes from Talking to Victor:
1) You CAN display MOs by iterating over the tiles from topleft to bottom right, even though some may take up multiple tiles, by giving them a frame count. i.e. you increment the frame count (a long?) each time you draw it and then if the frame count is already high enough then you don't have to draw it again.

2) You can fix the "MO stuck inside another MO that became relevant" problem by either ignoring it and letting the player reload the level, or by "killing" the MO and letting it respawn. It would be cool to gib the object too, just for fun, and seeing an object gib would be rare, unless you designed a level to do it. If you put a solid object in a spawn point, its a stupid idea, but the object would just gib over and over. You could also potentially have things blocked off entirely by being surrounded by tiles or stationary objects, but thats a level design consideration, not an engine consideration.

3) You can easily know which tiles to draw by adding the floor() and ciel() to the X and Y dimensions of tiles to draw around the character

4) The level object will have to take care of "step()" by checking a virtual method on the mappable objects which indicates if they are the player. If so, when he becomes aligned, step() should be called. 

5) The application should be able to query the level to get a pointer to the player. The level should keep a separate pointer latched so it doesnt have to
 search.

5) "Talk/prod" should be handled by the level, it looks at the players position and direction and determines the next cell over and executes talk on the first active MO there if any. The app just calls talk()

SKILLS:
Bartering: 10% off sales

Treasure Hunter: Sense when hidden treasure is near


IDOLS:
You should be able to obtain idols which shift the awards you get from battle from money to goods or vice versa.
A money idol shifts you to more money.
A weapon idol shifts you towards weapons.
A potion idol " " " " 
etc.

This can be done by providing a party-wide attribute like Money%, Weapon%, etc... which the idol shifts when equipped and unshifts when
unequipped. You could have only one idol equipped, and it equips to your whole party, in a special idol slot.... There should also be idols
which attract/repel monsters.
