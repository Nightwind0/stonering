
== Character Stats ==

Exponential Stats: c*b^L + d
Asymptotic Stats: 1 + s* pow(exp(r/s-1), L-1)

Calculating b for Exponential stats: 
b  = e^(ln(a)/c)

Where a is the multiplier, and c is the number of levels to achieve that multiplication.
So, to double every 10 levels, a = 2 (double) and c = 10. 

b = e^(ln(2)/10)






== Battle == 

Basic calculation of hit chance:
hit = your dex + your weapon's hit

hit_chance = hit * ( 1 - enemy's evade)

Experience calculation:
Calculate individually. For each party member, you calculate a separate XP for each monster killed. 
TNL() returns the amount of xp required for a particular level
B = number of battles (of same level monsters) required to level. Say maybe 10. (Because most monsters will be less than same level).
b is a rate, very similar to the rates used for character growth. When b = 1.07, then a monster 10 levels higher than you is worth
double the XP, and 10 levels below your level is worth half, and so on.
For each character C
	TOTAL_XP = 0;
	For each monster M
		XP = ((TNL(C.L+1) - TNL(C.L)) /  B) * b ^ ( M.L - C.L)
		TOTAL_XP += XP;
	Next
	print "Character C got TOTAL_XP experience"
Next
