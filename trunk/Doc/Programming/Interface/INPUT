Input should be configurable. Both the joypad and keyboard inputs should
be configurable. We can implement this using STL maps which map key definitions to the saved configured versions. For example


if(key == saved_key[LEFT])
	player.moveLeft();



etc...

Except that ClanLib has hooks so that you can define a key on the keyboard and a key on the joypad as one signal, and receive that signal. Either way, it needs to be configurable, BUT have a default configuration for starting a new game.
