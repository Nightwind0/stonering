1) In the properties window for a tile, you should be able to set the 4 direction block flags (N,S,E,W). This could be as simple as 4 checkboxes, I dont care.
2) You should be able to hold down a key to show the direction blocks on the level so far. Wherever there is a direction block, a colored line should be drawn above where the block conceptually is. Otherwise, blocking off regions would be hard.
3) As extra super bonus credit, if you could select entire regions of tiles and hit a button to set them as blocked on all sides, that would be neat. 

4)In fact, rubber-band selections of tiles in general would be handy. Something to think about. 

5) Similarly, there should be a way to quickly mark tiles as "hot", as well as check it on or off in the properties window per each tile


==== DESIGN ====


Really, level should create things using a factory, using Interfaces, that way we could swap in editable versions of all objects.
The IApplication could double as the factory, adding a series of create() methods, or the IApplication could provide the factory,
and the factory would have the create methods...otherwise, by default it's going to create uneditable versions of things
