<P CLASS="msonormal"><FONT SIZE=3>In the world of Aren</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;Long ago, when the Dragons were many and
had a vast and complex civilization, there was only one world, and in
it lived both Mortals and magical creatures. There were many Dragons
that did not like the peaceful ways of this civilization, and did not
like order. They worshiped chaos. Then Laeortis was born. He had an
evil heart from the time he hatched, and he quickly grew powerful.
Although he did not pose a threat to the emperor of the Dragons, who
was very powerful, Laeortis was able to slaughter countless Mortals.
It was the only way he could hurt the emperor of Dragons, who loved
the Mortals and sought to protect them. Although the emperor was
powerful, he was old, and Laeortis was young and fast, neither the
emperor nor his servants could capture him. After so many of the
Mortals were slaughtered that the emperor feared their extinction, he
developed a plan to divide the Mortals from magical creatures such as
Dragons and Elves, who were so powerful that the Mortals could never
stand up against them. The emperor, and his high counsel, a group of
the most ancient and powerful Dragons, used all of their power to
split the First World, into two realms; Solryel, the Mortal Realm,
and Gilderoth,&nbsp; the Immortal Realm. When this split was made, a
shard of the heart of that unified First World was accidentally
allowed to fall into the Mortal Realm. From this shard the Stone Ring
was carved, and because it is made of the living energy of both
realms, and imbued with magic by ancient Mortal sorcerers who were
friends of the Dragons, it can be used to travel between the two
realms. But it can only be used by mortals. After the splitting of
the realms, the emperor of the Dragons was weakened, as was his
council. Laeortis had gathered the Dragons that worshiped chaos into
an army, and he took this opportunity to kill the weakened emperor
immediately. Following was a great war between the Dragons of the old
world, and Laeortis’ followers. Most of the Dragons died in that
war, and when Laeortis eventually won, the remaining Dragons of the
old order went into hiding.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">In the Immortal Realm there are two main races:
the Dragons, and the Elves. In the case of both races there are good
guys and bad guys. Evil Dragons, such as Laeortis, and good Dragons
who are against them. However, Laeortis is the most powerful of the
Dragons, and that is why he has not been defeated. Also, Dragons are
the most powerful race, and there are only a few of them left (where
once there was a great and powerful civilization of Dragons) and
there are only scatterings and ruins of their culture. The other
Dragons are so scarce that the characters in the game do not
encounter another Dragon besides Laeortis. Then there is the main
population of the Immortal Realm, the Elves. Here there are two
distinct civilizations, the Dark Elves and the Light Elves. The Dark
Elves practice dark, or life sucking magic, and they are warlike and
evil. The Light Elves are healers, and scientists, they like to
explore and create art. The Light Elves are also the source of the
holy order of the Paladins. They founded the order, wrote it’s holy
texts, and chose the original knights in the Mortal Realm to be
trained by Elves, who then passed on their knowledge to their own
Mortal students.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Thousands of years later, in the Mortal Realm of
Solryel when the splitting of the First World was only legend and
song to most, a young boy by the name of Mordus came to possess the
Stone Ring. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">A secret guild of men who kept a history of the
First World became greedy and sought to open a connection between
Solryel and Gilderoth, in order to form alliances with the immortals
and harness their powers, and learn their magic in order to gain
great power and wealth. They were called the Keltin. But a small
group of the Keltin began to believe that opening a doorway to the
immortal would just allow Laeortis and other immortals to come into
Solryel and kill or enslave the entire mortal realm. This group
rebelled against the Keltin and formed the Rashan. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">But the Keltin continued to seek a way of
opening a door to the immortal realm, and so they learned of the
Stone Ring and sought it. After hundreds of years of searching they
Keltin learned that the Stone Ring was held in a small insignificant
village called Sirol, but the keepers were ignorant of it's true
power and meaning, and during the night it was stolen by the leader
of Keltin, a beastly man named Girwok. The villagers sent their
strongest warrior to slay Girwok and retrieve the Stone Ring. The
warrior killed Girwok, but the ring that he took back to the village
was a decoy, as Girwok had put the ring safely in the possession of
his son, Mordus.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The Stone Ring was the most beautiful thing
Mordus ever saw, and he wore it always. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">As a young man, Mordus went on a quest to the
Mountains of Norul, in order to slay Brigus, the King of the Ogres.
He would honor his people and make a name for himself that way. But
before he found Brigus , in the woods west of the Mountains of Norul,
he found a strange pool of water that glowed bright blue, and his
Strone Ring began to glow bright blue as well. He touched the pool
and was instantly transported to Gilderoth, the Immortal Realm. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">At first he wandered Gilderoth aimlessly, but
before long he took up residence in the town of Korrul, and there he
met many light elves, and they took him in as if he was one of their</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">own. The light elves raised Mordus and taught
him the ways of magic. As a young adult, Mordus surpassed his own
teachers in sorcery and became an Enchanter, far more powerful than
any of the elves, light or dark. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Laeortis heard of him, and suspected that he had
come from Solryel and sent his best Dark Elves to find him, in the
hopes that they would recover the Stone Ring. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The dark elves found Mordus and told him lies,
that he was wanted by an Elven King to attend a great dinner in his
honor. They brought him to the castle of Laeortis. Then, Laeortis put
a spell over Mordus, making him his slave. He then sent Mordus into
the mortal realm to rule it. This way the Mortal Realm posed little
threat while Mordus kept the Stone Ring safe, and Laeortis was free
to search for a way to use the Stone Ring to allow himself and his
immortal followers into the Mortal Realm. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Laeortis wished to rule the mortal realm. But
since he cannot himself go into the Mortal Realm, he sends Mordus
there to rule it long enough to devise a remerging of the two realms.
Once the empire is powerful enough, Laeortis will order Mordus to
have his league destroy or enslave all life in the mortal realm. Then
Laeortis plans to use the power of the Stone Ring to merge the two
worlds and dominate the unified world. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Dragons cannot leave the Immortal Realm. Because
Mordus has the Stone Ring, he can travel between the two realms, so
he is the only way that Laeortis can conquer the Mortal Realm. Elves
can travel back and forth through certain portals, so Laeortis, who
is in league with the Dark Elves, sends some Dark Elves to aid
Mordus. He would use the Elves to kill Mordus and take the Stone Ring
for himself, but Mordus is too powerful for the Dark Elves to kill,
and although he is under the control of Laeortis, his will is strong
enough so that Laeortis cannot command him to give him the ring, for
it is Mordus’ most prize possession. Laeortis only has a small
number of Dark Elves at his command, the majority of the Dark Elves
are not interested in conquering the Mortal Realm, and they only aid
Laeortis because they fear his power, but they are not ruled by him.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">As years go by, Mordus and his league of Dark
Elves grow strong, and their power overtakes almost all of the land
of Solryel. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The Keltin, still in existance, learn that
Mordus keeps the Stone Ring. But the secret connection between Mordus
and Laeortis is unknown to all but Mordus' closest kin, and in fact
no knowledge of Laeortis is known to the Keltin at all, and therefore
the Keltin believe that Mordus is selfishly keeping the ring for
himself and destroying the Keltin's plans to open a door between
Solryel and Gilderoth. They do not know that Laeortis would be quite
pleased with such a doorway, nor does Laeortis or Mordus know about
the Keltin and their plans, as Mordus does not remember his early
childhood, and therefore has forgotten the Keltin. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The Keltin, greedy to obtain the Stone Ring are
secretly plotting to infiltrate Mordus' army and assassinate Mordus.
<SUP>1</SUP></P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The Rashan as well are uneasy with Mordus owning
the Stone Ring, and are also plotting to return the ring to safety or
destroy it altogether. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">In Solryel, there is a small village of orphans,
who are raised by the gentle caretakers known as the Elders. In that
village lives a boy named Valyn. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Valyn’s sister Lorian was taken away to the
Immortal Realm when they were young. A traitor had allowed her to be
kidnapped. Originally, the Light Elves had planned to recruit Lorian
to become a high Paladin, as she has great natural potential. She was
to be trained by Elf Paladins, and to lead a war against the Dark
Elves. The Dark Elves learned of this plan, and so with the aid of
Dreegan, kidnapped her so that she could not become a danger to them.
Their folly is that her cellmate Shaya is a Paladin, and a great one
at that. The Dark Elves are oblivious to this fact. Shaya has hidden
the fact that she was a great Paladin, and trained Lorian in secret
so that should she escape, she can destroy the order of Dark Elves
and bring peace and healing back to the Magical Realm.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">One scournful day brings an attack on the
village of Tregar, the home of the orphans. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Valyn learns something from his Elder, Ordimus,
who is dying from an attack on the village by a person in a dark
cloak (who turns out to be a servant of Mordus, the evil overlord of
the world). He learns that the only way to the Immortal Realm is
through the use of the Stone Ring. The Elder hadn’t told him this
before because he wanted to protect him from the dangers of the
Immortal Realm. Valyn starts his quest to find and obtain the Stone
Ring.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Valyn first goes to his best friend Garian’s
house, and the two of them agree to go after the murderer in the dark
cloak. After asking around they discover that the dark cloaked person
escaped east of town into a cave. They believe he is hiding in that
cave. Valyn and Garian leave the town and head east, where the find
the cave. Down many levels into the cave they find the person in the
dark cloak. They encounter him and find that he is a servant of
Mordus, the evil ruler! They battle with him and cause him to run off
just before he is defeated. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">They return to town and Valyn decides that a
pursuit of the assassin is pointless, as the many minions and
monsters that serve Mordus will protect him. Instead, he decides that
he must focus his attention on finding his sister Lorian. Garian
agrees, and offers to help him on his quest.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">With Valyn’s Elder gone, Garian then
recommends they go to the temple of Elders and talk to Dreegan, who
raised Garian. Unbeknownst to Garian, Dreegan put a curse on Garian
so that whoever kills Dreegan, would become a target for
assassination by Garian. They go to the temple and Dreegan gives them
the quest for the lost scroll, which tells the history of the Stone
Ring, and might give them a clue as to where to find it. They are
told to look in the plains and search the tombs of the Elders. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Once they find the right tomb, they go down many
levels, at the bottom, they find Dreegan, and they learn that he was
a traitor who allowed Lorian’s kidnapping. (This roots back to
hatred between Dreegan and Ordimus that was well hidden and unknown
to Valyn and Garian.)<SUP>2</SUP> Valyn goes berserk and attacks
Dreegan, but Garian refuses to fight the man who raised him. Once
Dreegan is defeated, the curse overtakes Garian’s mind, and he
attacks Valyn. But Garian is defeated, and runs away. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Thanks to some small tips made by some people in
Balis (if the adventurer should choose</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">to venture there instead of to Goren)</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Valyn goes to the town of Goren to recover.
There he meets Torriq who is a Ranger. He knows of the curse of the
Elders and knows that the only way to break it is to destroy a marble
statue made in the image of one who cast the curse. To do this, they
must get a special enchanted hammer, which was broken into two
pieces. Then they must find the one who can repair it. Finally they
must return to the temple of the Elders, defeat Garian again and
destroy the statue.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Now no longer under the spell, Garian rejoins
the team. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Thankful for being freed from the spell, he,
Torriq, and Valyn continue Valyn's quest to find the Stone Ring. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">The three decide to head back to the elders and
see if they can find any new information.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">There they find Rashan Jon, an elder who is
quite wise and also quite insane.</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Rashan Jon is leader of the underground Rashan
guild, but neither Valyn nor his company knows who or what the Rashan
are. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">Rashan Jon, besides babbling a lot about
invisible squirrels, gives them some crucial information</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">about a town in the south where they will find
two wise men, Rui and Jershew. Rashan Jon</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">advises them to seek the knowledge of Rui and
Jershew. They travel south to the town</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">of Balis. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">At Balis they find a kindly gentleman who
invites them into his home. Inside his home</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">he introduces himself as Jershew. Jershew brings
out his companion, Rui, and the two explain that they believe the
Stone Ring to be in the posession of Mordus himself. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><SUP>1 </SUP>We shall see the Keltin again when
they join Valyn under the pretense of wanting to help him rescue
Lorian, and help him to defeat Mordus. At this time they are viewed
as good, and the Rashan failed to warn them of the plans of the
Keltin. But after the defeat of Mordus they then betray Valyn and his
crew and steal the Stone Ring. Valyn must then recover it from them,
with</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">the help of the Rashan, and Mordus who is no
longer under the control of Laeortis and realizes Laeortis' evil
plans. Here the Keltin are seen as a dangerous threat. Should Valyn
fail in recovering the Stone Ring in time, the Keltin may find a way
to use it to open a door to Gilderoth, and Laeortis would travel
through the door and enslave the mortals. But Valyn recovers the
Stone Ring from the dungeons of the Keltin's guild. In the end when
the Keltin learn of Laeotis and his intentions of ruling Solryel and
enslaving the mortals, the Keltin join the Rashan - and the Rashan
resolves to help Valyn destroy Laeortis. 
</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal">&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="msonormal"><SUP>2</SUP>Dreegan hates Ordimus because he is
the most wise of the Elders, and he has access to knowledge and texts
that no other Elder does. Furthermore, Ordimus announces that he
plans to train Valyn as his successor, instead of passing the role
onto Dreegan, who is younger than Ordimus and the second in command
of the Elders. Dreegan makes a deal with the Dark Elves, that if he
allows them to kidnap Lorian, they will also kill Ordimus, so that
Dreegan can assume control. However, Ordimus does not turn out to be
an easy target, and the Elves were really only interested in taking
Lorian, so once they have her, they escape. Ordimus does not learn of
Dreegan’s treachery at this time and so Dreegan is forced to go on
secretly plotting against Ordimus, and training Garian to be his
successor.
