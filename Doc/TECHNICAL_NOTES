== NPC =====
Non player characters will be loaded from a level file,
and they will consist of
1) An icon index number or numbers  which will indicate
	which icons to use for each direction the npc might face
2) A flag which indicates whether or not the npc moves around
3) A list of text which the npc will say, each text has a requirement
field which says something like "GB > 1000" or "WINDRUNE > 0" to indicate
that the text should only be said if the player has more than 1000 GB
, and the second case is that they have the WINDRUNE.
-However this should be changed to reflect events that have occured to the
player along with items in the inventories. There should also be
something to allow the npc to take the afformentioned item(s)
4) This might obsolete item 3, but NPCS should be able to have a list
of events, each with preconditions. Meeting the preconditions sets off
the events. These events might be rather silent and do nothing more than
take money from the player and then say something to him. For example,
you are to bring money to an NPC so that he tells you something, you
return, the event checks the precondition that you have the money,
then takes it, then says the appropriate thing.
-All events get stored in sort of an event inventory.
